 * Version 2.3  18 Jul 2015
 *
 * Read a zlib, gzip, or raw deflate stream and write a defgen-compatible or
 * simple binary encoded stream representing that input to stdout.  This is
 * based on the puff.c code to decompress deflate streams.  Note that neither
 * the zlib nor the gzip trailer is checked against the uncompressed data (in
 * fact the uncompressed data is never generated) -- only the fact that the
 * trailer is present is checked.
 *
 * Usage: infgen [-d] [-q[q]] [-i] [-s] [-r] [-b] < foo.gz > foo.def
 *    or: infgen [-d] [-q[q]] [-i] [-s] [-r] [-b] foo.gz > foo.def
 *
 * where foo.gz is a gzip file (it could have been a zlib or raw deflate stream
 * as well), and foo.def is a defgen description of the file or stream, which
 * is in a readable text format (unless -b is used).  The description includes
 * the literal/length and distance code lengths for dynamic blocks.  The -d
 * (dynamic) option generates directives to exactly reconstruct the dynamic
 * block headers.  With -d, the code lengths are still included, but now as
 * comments instead of directives.  The -q (quiet) option supresses the dynamic
 * block code lengths, whether as directives or as comments.  The -qq (really
 * quiet) option supresses the output of all deflate stream descriptions,
 * leaving only the header and trailer information.  However if -qq is used
 * with -s, the statistics information on the deflate stream is still included.
 * The -i (info) option generates additional directives for gzip or zlib
 * headers that permit their exact reconstruction.  The -s (statistics) option
 * writes out comments with statistics for each deflate block and totals at the
 * end.  The -r (raw) option forces the interpretation of the input as a raw
 * deflate stream, for those cases where the start of a raw stream happens to
 * mimic a valid zlib header.  The -b (binary) option writes a compact binary
 * format instead of the defgen format.  In that case, any other options except
 * -r are ignored.
 *
 * Both the defgen and compact binary formats are described below.

 defgen format:

    Content:

    The defgen format consists of lines of comments and directives.  Each line
    is terminated by a single new line character '\n', though it may be written
    as "\r\n" on systems with end-of-line conversions.  defgen accepts either.
    The directives are used to construct (or reconstruct) a deflate stream.
    Each directive is a word at the start of the line, possibly followed by
    parameters.

    Comments:

    defgen lines whose first character is an exclamation mark ('!') are
    comments, and are ignored by defgen.  Blank lines are also ignored.  All
    other lines are directives.  If an exclamation mark appears after a
    directive and not following a single quote, then it and the characters
    after it are a comment and are ignored.  infgen-generated informational
    comments are described below.

    Headers and trailers:

    The "gzip" directive writes a gzip header.  It is optionally preceded by
    directives bearing information to be contained in the gzip header: "name",
    "comment", "extra", "text', "time", "xfl", "os", and "hcrc".  The "name",
    "comment", and "extra" directives use the same parameter format as "data"
    and "literal" described below, and may be repeated over multiple lines for
    long content. For "name" and "comment", the parameters do not include the
    terminating zero.  For example:

    name 'linux-3.1.6.tar

    The "time", "os", and "xfl" (extra flags) directives each have a single
    numeric parameter. "os" and "xfl" have a parameter in the range of 0..255,
    and "time" is in the the range of 0..2^32-1.  infgen adds a comment after
    the time parameter with the local time zone interpretation of that value.
    If "os" is not present, it is taken to be 3 (for Unix).  If "xfl" or "time"
    is not present, the value is taken to be zero.  "text" and "hcrc" have no
    parameter.  "text" sets the text flag.  hcrc signals a two-byte crc of the
    header.

    The "crc" directive writes the CRC-32 of the uncompressed data in
    little-endian order.  The "length" directive writes the length of the
    uncompressed data, modulo 2^32, in little-endian order.  The combination of
    a crc and a length in that order is the gzip trailer.  Either or both can
    optionally have a numeric parameter in the range 0..2^32-1 which would be
    used in place of the value derived from the data.  infgen does not write
    those parameters.

    The "zlib" directive writes a zlib header.  The zlib directive has an
    optional numeric parameter which is the log-base-2 of the window size, in
    the range 8..15.  If there is no parameter, 15 is assumed.  zlib may be
    preceded by the "level" directive, which has one parameter: the compression
    level used when compressing in the range 0..3.  If level is not present, it
    is taken to be 2. zlib may also be preceded by a "dict" directive with the
    dictionary id as the numeric parameter, in the range 0..2^32-1.

    The "adler" directive writes the adler checksum of the uncompressed data in
    big-endian order.  This is the zlib trailer.  adler may optionally have a
    numeric parameter in the range 0..2^32-1 that is used in place of the
    actual adler checksum of the data.

    Deflate blocks:

    Deflate data between zlib or gzip headers and trailers, or raw deflate
    data, consists of a series of deflate blocks.  They are begun by the block
    type directives: "stored", "fixed", or "dynamic", and all end with "end"
    after the contents of the block. The last block has the directive "last" on
    its own line before the block type directive.  The "stored" directive has
    an optional parameter which is the data that fills in the dummy bits to get
    to a byte boundary.  If the parameter is not present, those bits are
    assumed to be zero.  An additional "block3" block type indicates the
    illegal bit pattern for a fourth block type.

    Block headers:

    Fixed blocks have no header, and proceed immediately to the data after the
    fixed directive.

    A stored block header has as many bits as needed to go to the next byte
    boundary (see the "stored" parameter above), followed by four bytes of
    block length information.  There is no directive for the length of the
    stored block, as it is implied by the amount of data up to the next end
    directive.

    A dynamic block has a header that describes the Huffman codes used to
    represent the literal/length and distance codes in the block.  That
    description is itself compressed with a third code.  The dynamic header is
    represented in one of two ways, or not at all.  If there is no description
    of the header, then the block data can be used to construct an optimal set
    of Huffman codes for the contained symbols, and an optimum way to encode
    them in the header.  In that case, the data immediately follows the dynamic
    directive.

    The first explicit way to describe the header is to list the number of bits
    in each literal/length and distance code.  This is done with the "litlen"
    and "dist" directives.  Each directive has two numerical parameters: the
    symbol index and the number of bits.  E.g. "litlen 40 9" or "dist 16 5". In
    this case, dynamic is followed by all of the litlen directives, which is
    followed by all the dist directives.  The litlen symbol must be in the
    range 0..285, and dist symbol must be in the range 0..29.  The number of
    bits for both must be in the range 1..15.  Only the symbols coded are
    listed.  The header description is complete upon encountering the first
    "literal", "match", or "end".

    The second, more proscriptive way to describe the header is to list the
    actual contents of the header, from which the code lengths are derived.
    This is done with the directives "count", "code", "lens", "repeat", and
    "zeros".  count has two parameters: the number of length code lengths,
    (257..286) and the number of distance code lengths (1..30).  code has two
    numerical parameters, the symbol index (0..18) and the number of bits for
    that symbol (1..7).  lens has any number of parameters in 0..15, where each
    is the length of the corresponding literal/length or distance code.  A zero
    length means that that symbol has no code and does not appear in the block.
    repeat and zeros each have one parameter which is the number of times to
    repeat a bit length.  repeat repeats the most recent length 3..6 times.
    zeros repeats zeros 3..138 times.  dynamic is followed by all of the code
    directives, and then by the len directives, with repeat and zeros
    directives mixed in.  The header description is complete upon encountering
    the first "literal", "match", or "end".

    Data:

    All compressed data is represented using three directives: "data",
    "literal", and "match".  "data" and "literal" have the same parameters and
    both directly represent bytes of data.  "data" is used only in stored
    blocks and literal is used only in fixed or dynamic blocks.  The parameters
    of data and literal are a series of decimal numbers separated by spaces,
    followed by a string of printable characters preceded by a single quote and
    ended by the end of line.  A single quote may appear within the string
    meaning a single quote in the data -- it does not end the string.  Either
    the numbers or the string are optional.  Each decimal number is in the
    range 0..255, and represents one byte of data.  The string can only contain
    printable characters in the range 32..126.  All other byte values must be
    represented as a decimal number.  match has two numerical parameters. The
    first is the length of the match, in 3..258.  The second is the distance
    back, in 1..32768.  The data ends with the "end" directive.

    After the last "end":

    If the last block does not end at a bit boundary, the "bound" directive has
    a single numeric parameter with the filler bits.  If bound is not present,
    the bits up to the byte boundary are filled with zeros.

    infgen comments:

    infgen starts with a comment line indicating the version of infgen that
    generated the defgen format output.  E.g. "! infgen 2.2 output".

    infgen inserts an empty comment, a line with just an exclamation mark,
    before each header, deflate block, and trailers.

    If the -d option is used and the -n option is not used, then the litlen and
    dist directives are written as comments.  E.g. "! litlen 40 9".  If -n is
    used, then they are not written at all.

    With the -s option, infgen will generate statistics comments, all of which
    begin with "! stats ".  There are statistics for each deflate block, and
    summary statistics after the last deflate block.  The statistics comments
    are as follows:

    "! stats table n:m" gives the total number of bytes and bits in the dynamic
    block header, not including the three block identifier bits.  For example,
    "! stats table 58:6" indicating 58 bytes and 6 bits = 470 bits.

    "! stats literals x.x bits each (n/m)" follows a fixed or dynamic block and
    gives the average number of bits per literal, the total number of bits for
    the literals in the block, and the number of literals in the block. For
    example, "! stats literals 5.7 bits each (3793/664)".  If the block has no
    literals, then "! stats literals none" will be written.

    "! stats matches x.x% (n x x.x)" follows a fixed or dynamic block and gives
    the percentage of the uncompressed bytes in the block that came from
    matches, the number of matches in the block, and the average match length.
    For example, "! stats matches 82.6% (183 x 17.2)".  If the block has no
    matches, then "! stats matches none" will be written.

    "! stats stored length n" follows each stored block and gives the number of
    uncompressed bytes in the stored block, which does not include the stored
    header.  For example: "! stats stored length 838" is a stored block with
    838 bytes.

    "! stats inout n:m (i) j k" follows any block and gives the total number of
    bytes and bits in the block, including the three-bit block identifier, the
    total number of symbols in the block (a literal and a match each count as
    one symbol), the number of uncompressed bytes generated by the block, and
    the maximum reach of the distances to data before the block.  For example,
    "! stats inout 1889:4 (1906) 3810 -1718" is a block with 1889 bytes and 4
    bits, 1906 symbols, 3810 uncompressed bytes, and maximum reach of 1718
    bytes before the block by a match in the block.  If the block does not
    reach before itself, the reach value is zero.

    After the last deflate block, total statistics are output.  They all begin
    with "! stats total ".  The block input and output amounts are summed for
    example as: "! stats total inout 93232233:0 (55120762) 454563840", with the
    same format as "! stats inout", except without the reach.

    "! stats total block average 34162.3 uncompressed" states for example that
    the average number of uncompressed bytes per block was 34162.3.  Similarly
    "! stats total block average 4142.5 symbols" states that there were 4142.5
    symbols on average per block.  "! stats total literals 6.9 bits each"
    states that there were 6.9 bits used on average per literal.  Lastly the
    matches are summed: "! stats total matches 95.2% (33314520 x 13.0)" with
    the same format as "! stats matches".

/*
    Compact binary format (-b) deflate content description (gzip and zlib
    headers and trailers are ignored):

    0..0x7f:     high byte of distance-1, followed by low byte of
                 distance-1, followed by length-3 (three bytes total)
    0x80..0xfe:  literals 0..0x7e
    0xff:        prefix byte, followed by ...
     0, 1:       stored block (1 = last), followed by leftover bits (one byte)
     2, 3:       fixed block (3 = last)
     4, 5:       dynamic block (5 = last), then header terminated by a 0 byte
     6, 7:       invalid block (7 = last)
     8:          end of deflate stream, followed by leftover bits (one byte)
     9..0x7e:    reserved (not used)
     0x7f..0xff: literals 0x7f..0xff

    dynamic block header:

    The binary dynamic block header description is terminated by a zero, and
    does not contain any zeros before that, in order to simplify decoding when
    the header is not of interest.  The raw header is described, in order to
    permit exact reconstruction if desired.  The header is this sequence of
    bytes:

    nlen - 256  number of length codes minus 256 (1..30, meaning 257..286)
    ndist       number of distance codes (1..30)
    ncode       number of code length codes (4..19)
    ncode *     ncode bytes follow:
        len+1   code length plus one (1..8, meaning 0..7)
    opcodes *   enough opcodes follow to desribe nlen + ndist codes
        opcode  each byte is 1..16 for lengths 0..15, or 17..20 to repeat the
                    the last length 3..6 times, or 21..156 to repeat zeros
                    3..138 times
    0           a zero byte terminates the header description

    Literals are coded on average to 1.5 bytes, though often less since low
    literals are more common.  Length-distance pairs are coded as three bytes.
    The coded form will be approximately 20% to 40% larger than the compressed
    form.
